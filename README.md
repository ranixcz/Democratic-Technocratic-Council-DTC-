# Democratic Technocratic Council (DTC)

### About the Project

This repository presents a **meritocratic-democratic framework** designed to improve governance efficiency while preserving public accountability.

The system proposes that leadership and policy decisions should not rely purely on popularity or party influence, but on **demonstrated competence, transparency, and data-driven results**. It introduces mechanisms where **elected representatives and qualified experts** work together under strict democratic oversight, forming a balanced structure that rewards merit without sacrificing equality.

While the concept shares some similarities with *technocracy*, it differs by grounding expert influence in **democratic legitimacy and public participation**, ensuring that expertise serves the people rather than replaces them.

The goal is to explore whether a system built on **merit, measurable performance, and rational governance** could offer an alternative to current democratic inefficiencies — **not as a replacement of democracy, but as its evolution.**

Feedback, critique, and counter-arguments are welcome — this project is a **theoretical experiment** meant to provoke discussion, not doctrine.
